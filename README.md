# Perceived route choices

This repository contains R code that analyzes data gathered from a lab experiment that studies the influence of time perception on route choices in public transport. A preprint that describes the methodology, results and theory behind these analysis is available at this [link](https://psyarxiv.com/t49kf/). A github repo with the lab experiment can be accessed at this [link](https://github.com/pabloguarda/route-choice-experiment).

 

## Development setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the script `main.R` located in the main folder of the repository
 
## Notes
1. The `scripts` folder contains all scripts that are sourced from the `main.R` script
2. `setup-libraries.R` installs the libraries and dependencies in your environment. If they had been installed already, the libraries are just loaded. 
3. The data is available under the folder `data`
4. The code is compatible with `R 4.2.3` and it takes less than 5 minutes to be executed on a computer with a processor of 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 and with memory of 16 GB ram.
5. The code of the experiment designed to collect this dataset is available at https://github.com/pabloguarda/route-choice-experiment
